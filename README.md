# Example React Native App with Passage Auth

### ðŸ”‘Â The easiest way to get passkeys up and running for React Native

[Passage](https://passage.id/)Â and the [Passage React Native SDK](https://github.com/passageidentity/passage-react-native) were built to make passkey authentication as fast, simple, and secure as possible. This example application is a great place to start. Before using Passage in your own React Native app, you can use this example app to:

- Plug in your own Passage app credentials to see passkeys in action
- Learn basic implementation of the Passage React Native SDK

A successful registration flow will look like this:

## Requirements

- Android Studio Electric Eel or newer
- Xcode 14 or newer
- A Passage account and Passage app (you can register for a free accountÂ [here](https://passage.id/))
- Completed setup of Associated Domains (iOS) and Asset Links (Android) files (view instructionsÂ [here](https://docs.passage.id/mobile/cross-platform/react-native/add-passage))

## Installation

```bash
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

## Configuration
To get this example React Native app working with your Passage account/app, you'll need to swap out the placeholder app id and authentication origin with your own. Learn more about Passage app ids and auth originsÂ [here](https://docs.passage.id/getting-started/creating-a-new-app).


### iOS
In the `Passage.plist` file ([found here](https://github.com/passageidentity/example-react-native/blob/main/ios/Passage.plist)) replace `YOUR_APP_ID`Â andÂ `YOUR_AUTH_ORIGIN`Â with your appâ€™s Passage app id and auth origin, respectively.

Also, you'll need to open up Xcode and replace `YOUR_AUTH_ORIGIN` in the Associated Domains section.

### Android

In theÂ `strings.xml` file ([found here](https://github.com/passageidentity/example-react-native/blob/main/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml))Â replaceÂ `YOUR_APP_ID`Â andÂ `YOUR_AUTH_ORIGIN`Â with your appâ€™s Passage app id and auth origin, respectively.

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">ExampleReactNative</string>

    <!-- Required Passage app settings -->
    <string name="passage_app_id">YOUR_APP_ID</string> 
    <string name="passage_auth_origin">YOUR_APP_ORIGIN</string>
    ...
</resources>
```

## ðŸš€Â Run the app!

```bash
npm run start
```

If all of the configuration was setup correctly, you should be able to run this application in the simulator or a real device!
