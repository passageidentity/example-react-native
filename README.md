# Example React Native App with Passage Auth

### ðŸ”‘Â The easiest way to get passkeys up and running for React Native

[Passage](https://passage.id/)Â and the [](https://github.com/passageidentity/passage-android)[Passage React Native SDK](https://github.com/passageidentity/passage-react-native) were built to make passkey authentication as fast, simple, and secure as possible. This example application is a great place to start. Before using Passage in your own React Native app, you can use this example app to:

- Plug in your own Passage app credentials to see passkeys in action
- Learn basic implementation of the Passage React Native SDK

A successful registration flow will look like this:
